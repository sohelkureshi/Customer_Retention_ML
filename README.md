## Project Overview

Customer retention is critical for maintaining revenue and growth. This project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to analyze customer behaviors and predict which customers are likely to stay or churn. By understanding these patterns, businesses can implement targeted strategies to improve customer loyalty.

The project covers:  
- Cleaning and preprocessing customer datasets  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify churn-related trends  
- Building and comparing multiple classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting  
- Evaluating models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC  
- Visualizing results to aid business decision-making  

## Key Features

- Robust data preprocessing and feature engineering  
- Detailed exploratory data analysis with visualizations  
- Multiple machine learning classification methods implemented and compared  
- Comprehensive model evaluation and metrics reporting  
- Easy-to-understand visual reports for business insights
